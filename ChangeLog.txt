[14.11][Jose Britto]:
Created EnemyBase.cs
Created SkeletonAi.cs
Added a variable 'ShowDebugMessages' to Npc.cs to control the messages shown in the console
Added EnemyState to Enums.cs
Added Health.cs to Player and all npcs to manage their health.
Upgraded postprocess stack from version 2.2.2 to 2.3.0 since the older one had a bug which shows random error messages.
